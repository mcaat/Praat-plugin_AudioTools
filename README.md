## Overview

**Praat AudioTools** is a collection of more than **250 scripts** for **audio processing, analysis, and synthesis** in [Praat](http://www.praat.org).  
The plugin adds a unified **AudioTools** menu to Praat, offering a wide range of effects, filters, transformations, and creative analysis-driven tools for sound design and experimental composition.

Developed for composers, sound designers, and researchers, the toolkit extends Praat's phonetic analysis environment into a **complete offline sound laboratory** — enabling processes such as granular synthesis, adaptive filtering, spectral manipulation, fractal reverbs, multichannel spatialisation, and machine learning-driven audio effects.

## Installation

1. **Download or clone** this repository.  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShaiCohen-ops/Praat-plugin_AudioTools.git
   ```

2. **Locate your Praat plugins folder.**  
   Depending on your operating system, Praat looks for plugins here:

   - **Windows:**   `C:\Users\<YourName>\Praat\plugins\`
   - **macOS:**     `~/Library/Preferences/Praat/plugins/`
   - **Linux:**     `~/.praat-dir/plugins/`

## Key Features

- **Offline, object-centric workflow
- **Edit PitchTiers, FormantGrids, TextGrids, and Tables as compositional scores. Work in an edit → render → listen loop with full reproducibility.
- **250+ processes across categories
- **Analysis, delay and temporal, distortion and dynamics, spectral and filter (FFT and LPC), modulation, pitch, convolution and reverb, spatial, and synthesis.
- **Analysis-driven mappings
- **Map pitch, formants and bandwidths, intensity, spectral centroid and flatness, zero-crossing rate, jitter, shimmer, and HNR directly to transformation parameters.
- **Flagship scripts (ready to use)
- **Adaptive Grain Cloud Synthesis (formant and spectral descriptor control of grain density, duration, and scatter)
- **8-Channel Spatial Canon / Speed Deviations (prosody to space: F0, intensity, speaking rate, jitter)
- **Reproducible by design
- **Scriptable parameters, seeds captured, versioned presets, optional ablation variants for method comparison.
- **Interoperability for composition
- **Cross-platform
